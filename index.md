# ChessML Documentation

Welcome to the ChessML documentation! This comprehensive guide covers chess programming concepts, from fundamental board representation to advanced search techniques.

## About ChessML

ChessML is a chess engine written in OCaml that demonstrates modern chess programming techniques. Whether you're new to chess programming or looking to understand specific optimizations, these guides will help you build a strong chess engine.

## Learning Path

### üéØ Beginner - Build a Basic Engine

Start with the fundamentals:
1. [Bitboards](docs/bitboards) - Represent the board efficiently
2. [Alpha-Beta Pruning](docs/alpha-beta-pruning) - Basic search algorithm
3. [Evaluation Function](docs/evaluation-function) - Material + piece-square tables

**Result:** ~1500-1800 Elo engine

### üöÄ Intermediate - Add Intelligence

Improve your engine's strength:
4. [Zobrist Hashing](docs/zobrist-hashing) - Position keys for caching
5. [Transposition Tables](docs/transposition-tables) - Cache search results
6. [Move Ordering](docs/move-ordering) - Try best moves first
7. [Quiescence Search](docs/quiescence-search) - Tactical stability

**Result:** ~2000-2200 Elo engine

### ‚ö° Advanced - Optimize Performance

Make your engine competitive:
8. [Magic Bitboards](docs/magic-bitboards) - Fast attack generation
9. [Null Move Pruning](docs/null-move-pruning) - Aggressive search reduction
10. [Late Move Reductions](docs/late-move-reductions) - Search deeper efficiently
11. [Static Exchange Evaluation](docs/static-exchange-evaluation) - Better capture evaluation
12. [Opening Books](docs/opening-books) - Opening knowledge

**Result:** ~2400+ Elo engine
