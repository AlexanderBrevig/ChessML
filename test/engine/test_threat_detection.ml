(** Tests for threat detection and piece safety evaluation 
    
    These tests verify that the engine correctly:
    1. Does NOT suggest Bxc6 as best move (it's a blunder that hangs the bishop)
    2. Shows eval DROP after playing Bxc6, not improve
    3. Detects hanging pieces correctly
    
    Current status: FAILING - These tests expose the bug where Bxc6 is suggested
    and the eval incorrectly improves by ~200cp after the trade.
